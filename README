This is a small library for the lcd controller pcd8544, used in 
Nokia 3310, 5110 and probably others, for Arduino (http://www.arduino.cc/) and
The Maple (http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/). Since the controller is'nt
pixel adressable it is used most as a text display, but simple graphics is
pretty straightforward to implement.

Look at the example sketch and the header file to see how to use the routines.

Both hard and software SPI can be used to communicate with the display.
(Software SPI not finished yet)

I have used it with an Arduino Duemillanove, a Maple rev.3, and 
"Graphic LCD 84x48 - Nokia 5110" from Sparkfun 
(http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168).

In the examples the lcd is connected as:

LCD        Arduino/Maple
8-LED      220ohm resistor to 5V or 22ohm to 3V3
7-SCLK     11 (cs_pin)
6-DN(MOSI) 13 (sdin_pin)
5-D/C      5  (dc_pin)
4-RST      6  (reset_pin)
3-SCE      7  (cs_pin)
2-GND      GND
1-VCC      3V3 (NOT 5V!)
